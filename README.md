# Anime Seasons

This repository includes anime season data for [Taiga](https://github.com/erengy/taiga), where it is used to display interactive season charts:

## Seasons

The data currently consists of all anime seasons between **Winter 2011** to **Spring 2018**.

Seasons are laid out in the following manner. Note that the winter season starts in the previous year (e.g. Winter 2016 starts in December 2015):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" colspan="3">Winter</th>
      <th align="center" colspan="3">Spring</th>
      <th align="center" colspan="3">Summer</th>
      <th align="center" colspan="3">Fall</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFFF">12</td>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFFF">1</td>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFFF">2</td>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFF0">3</td>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFF0">4</td>
      <td bgcolor="#F0FFF0">5</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FFFFF0">6</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FFFFF0">7</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FFFFF0">8</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FAEBD7">9</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FAEBD7">10</td>
      <td bgcolor="#FAEBD7">11</td>

## Database

The following information is available for each anime in a season:

Tag|Description
:--|:----------
`type`|1: TV<br>2: OVA<br>3: Movie<br>4: Special<br>5: ONA<br>6: Music
`id`|MyAnimeList ID
`producers`|Producers, licensors and studios
`image`|Poster image URL
`title`|Main romaji title

The rest of the information is retrieved directly from the active service by each client on demand. Ideally, it should have been possible to retrieve the entire information this way. But MyAnimeList does not provide such a method in its public API, which is why Taiga needs this database.

The XML files in this repository are generated by a Python script that scrapes HTML pages. The script is not provided here due to [ethical concerns](https://github.com/erengy/taiga/issues/244#issuecomment-206053747).

Note that the data for a season does not include series continuing from previous seasons. Also note that some files, especially the older ones, may be out of date.
